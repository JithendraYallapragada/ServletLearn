First of all

when user/client sends the request to the server regarding dynamic page the server sends the Request to the web container
web container alias the server like apache tomcat/ibm/etcc..
so here the web container contains the deployment Descriptor where the deployment descriptor contains web.xml where it defines the 

servlet         and       servlet mapping
name ----                 name 	matches
class of java----         url finds

whenever the servlet names matches then the url contains name execues and give response

hence now the java class file executes

java file with class name mentioned in servlet in pom.xml

execute the methodn and gives response to the client

follow the files in the repo to reach the content
